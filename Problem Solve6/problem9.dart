/*
9. Range Sum

Write a function that takes a list of integers and two indices, start and end, and returns the sum of the elements in the list between those indices (inclusive).

Example Input: ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], start = 1, end = 3)

Example Output: 9 (since 2 + 3 + 4 = 9)

Hint: Use slicing to extract the sublist and calculate the sum.
